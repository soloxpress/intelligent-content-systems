# 🧐 Intelligent Content Systems — 6-Week Learning Path  
*By Solomon Osadolo*

> A structured learning and practice journey to build expertise in intelligent content architecture — spanning structured authoring, metadata design, CCMS workflows, and AI-readiness.

---

## 🌟 Purpose  
This repository documents my hands-on learning journey inspired by the **Principal Content Architect** role at ServiceNow.  
Over six weeks, I’ll explore how structured content, metadata, and intelligent workflows can make enterprise content scalable, discoverable, and ready for AI systems.

## 🗓 6-Week Overview

| Week | Focus Area | Key Outputs |
|------|-------------|-------------|
| **1** | Structured content foundations (DITA/XML/JSON) | Content model, sample topics, metadata schema |
| **2** | Content modeling & knowledge graph design | Diagram + relationships between entities |
| **3** | CCMS workflows & Docs-as-Code practice | GitHub repo, modular templates, automated publishing |
| **4** | AI integration & knowledge graph querying | Prompt examples, metadata-driven content retrieval |
| **5** | Accessibility, localization, and personalization | Annotated topic examples, translation-ready templates |
| **6** | Analytics, optimization, and portfolio synthesis | Final demo + case study documentation |

## 🟩 Capstone Goal  
By the end of this program, I’ll design a working **Intelligent Content Architecture Demo** for a fictional SaaS product, showing how structured, metadata-rich content can:  
- Scale across channels  
- Power personalization and conversational UX  
- Integrate seamlessly with AI/LLM systems  
- Enable analytics-driven optimization  

---

## 📚 Learning Log  
Each week includes:  
- **Daily reflections** (`/week-x-.../04_reflections/`)  
- **Artifacts** (DITA topics, schemas, and diagrams)  
- **Wrap-up summaries** capturing insights and next steps
